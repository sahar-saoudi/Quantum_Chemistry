In this project, our aim is to calculate the dissociation curve of the H2 molecule, that is to say the curve of the total energy of the molecule as a function of the distance between its two nuclei. This curve should
pass through a minimum: the equilibrium position of this molecule. To do this, my teammates and I : 

- Used th Jordan-Wigner encoding to construct quantum operators, based on the Pauli channels, which have the same properties as the fermionic creation and annihilation operators.
- Assembled these operators to obtain the molecular Hamiltonian in the form of a linear combination of Pauli channels.
- Use the estimator developed in the Quantum Tomography project to estimate the average value of the Hamiltonian for a given quantum state.
- Constructed a parameterized quantum circuit which allow the preparation of quantum states to represent the occupation state of the electrons.
- Used a minimization method and the variational principle to find the fundamental energy for the H2 molecule.
- Found the fundamental energy for several interatomic distances in order to draw the curve of dissociation of the H2 molecule.
